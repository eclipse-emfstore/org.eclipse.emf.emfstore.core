# Contributing to EMF Client

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The Eclipse EMF Client Platform is a framework for building EMF-based client
applications. The goal is to provide reusable, adaptable and extensible UI
components to develop applications based on a given EMF model. All components
can be used stand-alone and be embedded into your own application. To get
started, ECP provides a demo application, which integrates all provided
components. This demo application allows you to get started by only providing
your EMF model.
